import { memo } from "react"

First things run whn javacript eteute

GLOBAL Execution context (which refere this)
Functional Execution Context
Eval Execution Context (mongoose)


GLOBAL Execution contsxt runs in two phase

1.Memory Creatinon phase (memory is craeted)
2.Execution phase

example
let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5

function addNum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1+ num2
    return total
}

let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 20)

Here first thing  runs in global Execution context (which refer this)
1.Memory Creation phase
then it goes to memory phase (it creates memoy value will be undefinde
    here val1 and val2 is undefined
    in function defination will goes
    result1 and result2 will be undefined
)
FIrst cycle is completed

2.Execution phase
here val 1 = 10, val2=5

addNum = it will create a new executaila context
(New variable evionrmnt + new executional
    context so memroy creation phase and excuetioh phase will be created again 
    for ad num functo)

1.Memory Creation phase (val1 , val2 amd total will be undefined )
2.Execution phase (10 + 5  total = 15)
now todal will be rutned to global Execution context
note after createing execitioan context it will deletd)

next process will contonues as we have addNum
